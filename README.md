# Overview

This repository contains a small clicker style game created with the Godot Engine.  The project started as a way to become more familiar with Godot’s user interface system and basic scripting.  It is meant to be a simple showcase of incrementing values, purchasing upgrades and introducing passive income.

The player presses the computer button on screen to earn score.  That score can then be spent on upgrades that increase the amount gained per click or on autoclickers that generate points every second.  Upgrades scale in price the more they are bought which encourages continued interaction.

The game was written to practice GDScript and explore how Godot scenes can be composed into a user interface.  The code base is small but provides a foundation that can be expanded with additional features such as animations or sound.

Demo video not yet available.

# Development Environment

The project was created with **Godot 4** using the built in script editor.  All gameplay logic is written in **GDScript**.  Assets were assembled with simple PNG images and an open‑source font.
